## Guide
By using html, php, and CSS I created a website that shows tables from a database and lets you submit queries on said database.

### HTML | CSS | PHP
1.**HTML:** I used html to do the create the main part of the webpage, lots of html tables were used in order to display the separate tables data. I used a .csv to html table online translator to get the excel data in html table form. 

2.**PHP:** I used php to put the code in the html doc that connects to the database on the server. The server has postgreSQL on it in order for my webpage to be able to communicate with it. All of the DB files are stored in the server as well. I also used php for the query input box and for grabbing query results from the server. The php code is in the index file.

3.**CSS:** I used CSS for all the general formatting of the webpage and stylizing.
